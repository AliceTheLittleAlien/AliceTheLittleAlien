Hi! ♡ I’m @AliceTheLittleAlien 👽 ♡ [She/Her] ♡ You can reach me on Discord: alicethelittlealien 📫 

♡ I’m currently learning how to develop in Godot using GDScript 👾 Starting off with a 2D Platformer! 🌱

♡ I’m interested in 3D modeling using Blender; 2D and 3D development using Godot; Pixel Art; Sound Design, Soundtracking & Voice Acting; Story, Character & World Building. 🕹️

♡ I’m looking to collaborate on cool passion projects with a clear vision. I play into my strenghts in visual art and sound.

♡ Fun fact: I'm a multi-genre singer-songwriter, producer and rapper! I've always aimed to merge my goals in game dev and game design with my passion for music by doing sound design and soundtracking for games! 🎵
